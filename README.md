# MicrobDetect
MicrobDetect is a pipeline to identify and to profile the microbiome content from the whole genome shotgun sequencing data of the clinical samples. The clinical samples, e.g. the biopsy samples from the human stomach mucosal, might contain mostly human DNA and very low abundance of microbial DNA. The generic tools developed for the metagenomic whole shortgun sequencing data profiling tools may not be suitable for those clinical microbial analysis. We therefore developed "MicroDetect" pipeline.
